### Unsupervised Semantic Polarity Detection on Foursquare Comments
This project is related to my BSc. final project/thesis.

This is the tool that I developed to analyse Foursquare comments, in order to create a dictionary of words which I later used to calculate semantic polarity of sentences.

I developed the application in Ruby utilising JRuby. I've used Stanford NLP and MongoDB as well as R language to present the results.
